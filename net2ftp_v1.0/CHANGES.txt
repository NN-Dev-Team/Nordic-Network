Minor upgrade release. 

- Improvement: it is now possible to upload files from the Browse screen using
  the SWFUpload Flash applet.
- Improvement: a list of allowed IP addresses from which users may connect
  can be specified in settings_authorizations.inc.php.
- Improvement: added data transfer statistics (blue skin).
- Improvement: updated the Mambo skin and added code to integrate net2ftp with
  Joomla 1.0.12.
- Bugfix: the character encoding added in version 0.94 didn't work well for 
  German (umlaut) and French special characters. Character encoding is now
  only applied for Japanese, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, and also
  for the UTF-8 languages (Arabic, English, Vietnamese).
- Bugfix: PNG images with transparent regions are now fixed in PHP, which works
  better than the Javascript fix (pngfix.js). For people who want to integrate
  net2ftp in another PHP application which fixes PNG images in another way, it 
  is still possible to turn off the correction in settings.inc.php.
- Bugfix: the JUpload applet didn't work any more because cookie information
  wasn't passed through. (Still doesn't work with Opera though.)
- Bugfix: recursive chmodding first chmods the subdirectories and files when
  chmodding to for example 444, before chmodding the parent directory.
- Bugfix: some XHTML validation fixes.
- Bugfix: files which have filenames containing special characters are now
  displayed correctly. When downloading, the filename is preserved on IE (not
  yet on Firefox - if anyone knows a fix send an email to david at net2ftp dot 
  com).
- Bugfix: fixed the Edit and View links on the Browse screen (blue skin).
- Bugfix: removed the check on IP address changes, as this may be the cause for
  some people to have to re-enter the login information too often.
- Information: the JUpload applet was not updated to the 0.90 version because 
  the new applet is too large (441 kB) - this would cause unacceptable download 
  times for people which are not on broadband.



February 2007: version 0.95
===========================

Bugfix release. Thanks to everyone who has posted new code and bug reports!

- Improvement: when using net2ftp in Japanese and editing files, it is now
  possible to choose the character encoding (UTF-8, EUC-JP or SJIS). 
- Bugfix: the unzipping has been fixed; the temporary subdirectories were not
  created with the required permissions.
- Bugfix: following symlinks did not work properly due to a mistake in the skin
  files; this is now fixed.
- Bugfix: this version now includes the new Blue skin.



November 2006: version 0.94

----------
net2ftp version 0.94 contains:

Release with new (mainly security-related) features

- Improvement: a list of banned keywords can be entered in 
  settings_authorizations.inc.php. Directories and files containing these 
  keywords can't be processed. Files can't be renamed if the new filename
  contains a banned keyword. This is to avoid net2ftp being used to upload
  Paypal and Ebay scams.
- Improvement: 2 new fields have been added in the net2ftp_log_access table: 
  the data transfer volume and the script execution time. 
- Improvement: the (encrypted) FTP password is not passed from page to page 
  any more as hidden input field, but using sessions. When the session times
  out, when cookies are deleted or if the user's IP address changes the 
  password has to be entered again.  
- Improvement: the "Helene" code editor is replaced by CodePress.
- Improvement: the number of settings have been reduced in settings.inc.php.
- Improvement: the code to integrate net2ftp within Joomla has been updated to
  work with Joomla 1.0.11 (previously: 1.0.8).
- Bugfix: a cross-site scripting bug has been fixed.
- Bugfix: files bigger than the "max_filesize" setting were not always skipped.
- Bugfix: fixed some Notice messages in the Mambo and Joomla integration files.
- Bugfix: replaced style="white-space: nowrap;" by wrap="nowrap" on the Edit
  screen, as IE stripped the carriage-return and linefeed characters.
- Bugfix: cookie value for skin and language preference was not taken into account.
- Bugfix: clear cookies functionality was broken.
- Bugfix: fixed HTML errors (bookmark and error screens).
- Bugfix: consumption figures were increased even when the daily limit was reached
  and the file was not transferred.

net2ftp v0.94 is also available in a light version with less plugins, skins and languages.
The normal version takes 8.9 MB, the light version 4.9 MB.



September 2006: version 0.93
============================

New release

- Improvement: a new module has been written to install packages. A user can
select a package from a list of popupar Open Source applications (e.g. Mambo, 
PHPBB, ...), this package is then fetched from its website (Sourceforge), 
unzipped and the directories and files are uploaded to the FTP server. Packages
in the zip, tar, tgz and gz format are supported. 
Note: the net2ftp install script is copied by net2ftp to the FTP server, and 
runs there. In order to use it, the target directory must be accessible via the
web and the web server must be able to run PHP.

- Improvement: the unzip function has been rewritten to improve the speed.

- Improvement: translation into Swedish

net2ftp v0.93 is also available in a light version with less plugins, skins and languages.
The normal version takes 8.6 MB, the light version 3.5 MB.

----------

New release with improvements, bugfixes and a new language file
- Improvement: The "max_filesize" setting prevents big files from being 
  processed by net2ftp. Files bigger than this limit can't be uploaded, 
  downloaded, copied, moved, searched, edited or viewed. They can still be 
  deleted, chmodded or renamed.
- Improvement: Archives can be unzipped on the FTP server
- Improvement: Symlinks are now handled much better; first net2ftp checks if
  it points to a directory or a file; if it's a directory, you're redirected
  to that directory; if it's a file, the file is downloaded.
- Improvement: The mapping between the FTP directory and the HTTP directory
  now checks if the FTP directory contains special names, like "htdocs" or
  "public_html". If it does, the HTTP root directory is set accordingly.
- Improvement: If a file can't be moved, the processing of that subdirectory
  is aborted (remaining files are not moved and subdirectory is not deleted)
- Improvement: New language files for Arabic
- Improvement: CSS styles and images are mirrored for right-to-left languages
- Bugfix: Content of the <body> tag is now handled correctly in the HTML editors

net2ftp v0.92 is also available in a light version with less plugins, skins and languages.
The normal version takes 7.6 MB, the light version 3.0 MB.


May 2006: version 0.91a

A new release with enhancements and bugfixes.

Enhancements:

- Big change in the overall architecture of net2ftp, for 2 reasons:
    - to allow easy integration of net2ftp within other web-based applications;
    - to separate the programming logic from the presentation logic; net2ftp
      now uses templates.
- In the /integration directory you'll find instructions and code on how to 
  integrate net2ftp in 3 popular content management systems: Mambo, Drupal and
  Xoops.
- Tested on PHP 5.0.3.
- Improved script speed through analysis of the slower parts.
- New functionality: send arbitrary FTP commands to the FTP server (on PHP 5 only).
- New skin for mobile users (PDA, phone)
- Removed the HTML editor HTMLArea, as the development of it has stopped.
- Added the HTML editor TinyMCE.
- Added title icons.
- Replaced fpassthru() by fread() to save memory when downloading large files.
- Support for right-to-left languages.
- Reduced the nr of settings in settings.inc.php.
- Support for IE 7.0 (user agent).
- Improved sorting according to the modification time and file type.
- Status indicator code is now on skin level (status bar for Blue skin, status 
  circle for Pastel skin).
- The home directory of users can now be set in a new table "net2ftp_users".
- Improved input validation.

Bug fixes:

- When changing the language on the login screen, the screen is refreshed. The values 
  of the other fields (FTP server, username, etc) were erased during the refresh. 
  This is now fixed.
- Sticky bit permission with capital T was not recognized in ftp_scanline. Also added:
  s and S.
- Bug when downloading a file: error message got appended to the content.
- Bug in the copy/move/delete process, when the directory listing could not be retrieved,
  and when the directory contained double slashes.

----------

A new release with enhancements and bugfixes.

Enhancements:
- It is now finally possible to upload directories and files using a Java 
  Applet (JUpload). Thanks to Mike Haller for making this great applet!
- A new feature lets you install HTML templates on your website. This is great
  for non-technical users who want to set up a website quickly. Look for the
  new "HTML templates" button on the Browse screen.
- A new plugin has been added to view code with syntax highlighting: GeSHI. This
  plugin supports many more programming languages.
- net2ftp now uses 2 new iconsets which are released under the LGPL license, 
  which make them free for all use (the Crystal icons were "free for non-commercial 
  use").
- The new settings file settings_screens.inc.php lets you choose which fields have
  to be displayed or hidden on the login screen, and which functions have to be 
  enabled or disabled (eg. copy, chmod, upload,...).
- FTP rawlist scanning rules should be faster now, as ereg() is replaced by preg_match().
  In other areas of the code ereg() has also been replaced by preg_match(), or even
  by strpos() when regular expression matching was not really needed.
- Help pages have been updated.
- Plugin versions and language files have been updated.
- Unnecessary plugin files have been removed (smaller size and increased 
  security).
- Plugin language is derived from net2ftp language (for plugins: HTMLArea 3.0 RC1,
  jscalendar 0.9.6 and FCKEditor 2.0 RC2).
- Logs are deleted automatically after 14 days; this can be configured in 
  settings.inc.php.
- Skins have been sorted; pastel moved up; grey and yellow moved down.
- The total nr of directories/files and the total size of the files is printed
  on the Browse screen.
- An index has been added for all MySQL tables. A DROP TABLE IF EXISTS 
  statement has been added to make upgrades easier. This will delete existing 
  logs.
- registerglobals.inc.php has been cleaned up.
- shutdown() fixed for PHP configurations where max_execution_time is -1.

Bug fixes:
- The net2ftp code was reviewed for security, following the recent release of 
  different worms which target PHP web applications (Santy).
  The mistakes which were checked are those explained in the article "PHP 
  Security Mistakes" by Dave Clark.
  http://www.devshed.com/c/a/PHP/PHP-Security-Mistakes/
      1. Never include, require, or otherwise open a file with a filename based 
      on user input, without thoroughly checking it first.
      ==> Done.
      2. Be careful with eval().
      ==> net2ftp translation files must be checked for malicious code.
      3. Be careful when using register_globals = ON.
      ==> All auto-registered variables are now unset(), and after that
      only those variables which are needed are declared.
      This works on all servers, whereas a .htaccess file only works on Apache.
      4. Never run unescaped queries.
      ==> All variables are passed through addslashes() when executing a SQL 
      query.
      5. For protected areas, use sessions or validate the login every time.
      ==> Login is checked on each pageload, also for the Admin section.
      6. If you don't want the file contents to be seen, give the file a .php 
      extension.
      ==> Done.
- The HTTP authentication code (used when logging in via a Bookmark and
  when using the Admin panel) has been improved to work with different
  kinds of PHP setups (external authentication, PHP as CGI, IIS ISAPI). 
  Due to external restrictions however, there are no workarounds when 
  PHP is running as CGI module AND mod_rewrite is not available.
- Zip files created by net2ftp can now be viewed using Windows XP's file
  manager. They looked empty before. The reason is that there may not 
  be a leading / in the filename.
- Upload-and-untar is fixed.
- The Copy/move check if the target directory is "same as or subdirectory of" 
  the subdirectory was not correct.
- The cookie for remembering the last FTP mode was not working. This is fixed.
  The default is still BINARY.

By the way: recursive chmod was already present in version 0.81, but not 
mentioned below.



October 2004: version 0.81
==========================

----------
net2ftp version 0.81 contains:
- HTMLArea version 2.0.3
- HTMLArea version 3rc1
- FCKEditor version 1.5
- Helene version 0.5
- pclzip version 2.1
- pcltar version 1.3
- jscalendar version 0.96
- Everaldo's Crystal icons
----------
net2ftp version 0.81 is translated into:
- Czech
- German
- Spanish
- French
- Italian
- Dutch
- Polish
- Russian
- Traditonal Chinese
----------

This release is the first to contain code contributed by Jakub: 
- view an image on the FTP server (Slynderdale added the same for SWF movies)
- better handling of symlinks
- better password encryption
- upload an unlimited nr of files (still restricted by the script timeout though!)
- many bugfixes both in PHP and HTML

The application has also been reworked to be translated.

Based on requests of some users in the forum, net2ftp now also contains 3 "WYSIWYG" 
HTML editors and one syntax highlighting editor. (The syntax highlighter editor is 
turned off by default, as it is not very stable.)

A kind of plugin system has been developed; it is used by the editors, and by the
version checking tool made by Slynderdale. It provides a standard procedure to:
- include PHP and Javascript files
- run Javascript code in the HTML header
- run Javascript code at the body onload event
However, because each external application has its own requirements, manual
intervention deep in the code is still needed besides this -- have a look at 
the printEditForm() function in the file edit.inc.php to see how the editors 
are plugged in.

Actions like save, bookmark, etc can now be executed using the keyboard.
Which letter can be used is displayed in the tooltip.

Google Ads have been added, but they are turned off by default if you install net2ftp
on your own server.

There is new code to prevent abuse (people transferring huge amounts of data).
This functionality requires a MySQL database.
A daily limit on data transfer volume and on script execution time can be set. 
Once this limit is reached, the user can still browse the FTP server but not
transfer data any more.
The data transfer volume and script execution time are logged per IP address and
per FTP server. 

The admin panel has been improved:
- It can now be accessed from the main page.
- The username and password can be set in settings.inc.php (this is easier than using
  the .htaccess and .htpasswd files)
- The code to retrieve the SQL logs is faster

Bugfixes:

* When a file was moved to the same directory, it was deleted. Thanks to Enigma for 
  pointing that out.

* Some HTML errors were corrected (Jakub)

* The HTTP headers have been improved

* Minor error handling improvement


March 2004: version 0.80
========================

----------
net2ftp version 0.80 contains:
- htmlarea version 2.0.3
- pclzip version 2.1
- pcltar version 1.3
- Everaldo's Crystal icons
----------

A new version with lots of additional features:

* Directories, files and symlinks are shown together and can be manipulated
  together

* The size taken by directories and files can be calculated; the directories
  are processed recursively.

* Directories and files can be searched for a word; the directories
  are processed recursively.

* The upload-and-unzip function works now even if the Zip module of PHP is not 
  installed, thanks to the pclzip library (see /includes/pclzip.lib.php). 

* The upload-and-unzip function works now also for Tar archives, thanks to the
  pcltar library (see /includes/pcltar.lib.php).

* When uploading files, a popup message appears to tell: 1- to be patient and
  2- that if the upload takes more than x seconds, it will be halted and he'll
  have to try again with less/smaller files.

* Functions which are not yet totally implemented can be turned on or off in
  settings.inc.php.

* If you don't know which function generates a particular output, you can turn a 
  setting on in settings.inc.php, then extra hidden HTML tags will be added 
  by each function.

* There are 2 troubleshooting functions: one to troubleshoot net2ftp on a
  webserver, and another one to troubleshoot an FTP server.

* While the script is executed, the status is displayed on top of the page.

* Selected rows have another background color

* The number of settings in settings.inc.php have been reduced
  to make net2ftp easier to configure. Some were not really used.

* When logging in the passive mode can be set

* The cookies set by net2ftp can be cleared from the login page

* The list of directories and files can be sorted based on the filename, size,
  modification time, etc

* Version checking script can automatically check if a new version of net2ftp
  exists

* Added support for Lycos Tripod and Earthlink, so that the Open link would work
  on the Browse page (printURL() function in browse.inc.php).

* New 16x16 icons which take less space and look nicer

* All icons are .png; workaround applied for IE which does not display 
  transparent png images nicely by default

* New onMouseOver effect for the action icons

* Bugfix: when the login directory was "" the user was directed to the root
  directory instead of his home directory

* Bugfix: when a file was downloaded, the filename was appended by ".txt" 
  and a line was added at the end of the file (reported by Jean-Pierre and
  corrected by Slynderdale)

* Bugfix: files with a filename which starts with a dot are transferred 
  using the FTP_ASCII mode


September 2003: version 0.73
============================

* Two of Slynderdale's add-ons are now integrated in the main release: 
  - the directory can be set on the login page
  - there is an anonymous login checkbox on the login page. (Last minute note:
    this one is included but put in comment, because there is a small bug that
    I couldn't solve.)

* A default directory can be specified in the settings.inc.php file.

* Bugfix: . and .. entries are removed now

* Bugfix: ftp_zipdirectory bug is fixed


September 2003: version 0.72
============================

* Added flush() in functions that can take some time (copy/move/delete and 
  upload) so that the intermediate results would be shown on screen 
  immediately.

* Help guide in HTML

* Added a shutdown function to display a warning and delete temporary files
  when the script reaches the maximum execution time and is stopped

* Small cosmetic changes to the layout

* Bugfix: when doing an upload-and-unzip of 1 or more archives, it was 
  necessary to also provide a normal file to upload.

* Bugfix: the link to the icons of video and wav files were broken.

* Bugfix: when the email could not be sent, the temporary file was not deleted.

August 2003: version 0.71
=========================

* Bugfix: the /temp directory was getting full of temporary files that were
  not deleted in case of error.

* The /icons directory is renamed to /images.


July 2003: version 0.7
=======================

* New layout and new icons

* Email directories and files using a zip file attachment

* If a subdirectory does not exist, the user is redirected to the root directory

* Small bugfixes


June 25, 2003: build 0030
=========================

Developers release.

* Better scanning of the ftp_rawlist output generated by the FTP server 
  See file browse.inc.php, function ftp_scanline().
  Two major changes here: 
    1- instead of listing the allowed characters in the regular expression, 
       it works the other way around: the unwanted characters are listed.
    2- if the scanning does not work, net2ftp tries again with a less
       strict scanning method, and in the end, if a line is still not work,
       the original raw list string is shown on the browse page.

* When ftp_chdir returns false, no error message is printed.
  See browse.inc.php, function ftp_getlist.
  Some FTP servers seem to return FALSE even if the directory exists...(right?)

* Some small changes in cleanDirectory(), glueDirectories() etc
  See filesystem.inc.php.
  All directories should be in the format /dir/subdir (leading / and no trailing /).
  The root directory is /. Only in ftp_getlist, a directory "" can be used.

* A small text is added on the Upload screen, to explain to webmasters where the
  upload-unzip feature should be, once the zip module of PHP is installed.
  (Note: Slynderdale is working on a version which would not need this module.)

* A .htaccess file is added, to handle HTTP errors.
  The drawback of this file is that the path should be edited. I am still
  looking for a better solution.


June 7, 2003: version 0.61
==========================

Minor bugfix release:

* Some FTP servers (Windows) do not accept ftp_chmod commands when there is a 
  leading slash in the directory name.


May 2003: version 0.6
=====================

This release is the first to contain code contributed by Slynderdale: the zip 
download of files, the WYSIWYG edit form (only for Internet Explorer 5.5 or 
higher), the listing of directories.

New features:

* Zip download of directories and files. 

* Zip upload; the files are decompressed on the web server, and transferred to 
  the FTP server.

* WYSIWYG form can be used to edit text files, when the browser is IE 5.5 or 6.0.

* Most pages can be bookmarked. When a bookmark is used to access a net2ftp page,
  a popup window asks for the username/password to be used on that FTP server. The
  password is not saved in the bookmark.

* On most pages where a directory can be entered, a "List" link opens a popup
  window which allows to browse through the directory structure and choose a
  directory.

* Authorization check on FTP server port. The admin can set authorized ports to ALL
  or to a certain port nr. In this last case, the port nr textbox is suppressed from
  the login page.

* Upload page: it is possible to enter another directory on the first page, and 
  to to upload another 5 files from the upload result page.

* The nr of files that can be uploaded at once can be set in settings.inc.php.

* The location of net2ftp on the server is determined automatically; there
  is no need to enter it in settings.inc.php any more.

* A check is made to see if the FTP module of PHP is installed.
  The modules needed for zip upload (Zip and Zlib) are optional. If they are
  not installed, the extra buttons and textboxes are suppressed.

* New functionality on the administrator page

Bugfixes:

* Some FTP servers do not show hidden files by default.
  By using the -a option those files are now shown. 

* Some FTP servers return fake directory entries "." and ".." which caused
  infinite loops in the copy/move/delete functions. These entries are now
  filtered out.

* There was a problem with javascript on the Browse page, if a directory or 
  filename contained a single quote. This is solved now.

* The directories and files are shown when connecting to the AS400 FTP server.


March 2003: version 0.5
=======================

New features:

* The directory that was last used, is saved in the cookie; when logging in
  later on, that directory is used. If the directory has been deleted in the 
  meanwhile, an error message is shown, and the cookie information is reset.

* Some of the layout settings which were coded on server side in 
  settings.inc.php and in the browse/edit/... functions have been replaced by 
  styles in the css files

* The HTML that is generated is now valid HTML 4.01 Transitional, or almost.
  (There are some features that most browsers can handle, but which are not
  foreseen in the standard, such as the wrap attribute of a textarea, used
  when editing text files.)


Bugfixes:

* When logging in for the first time, the directory is "/" instead of "".
  On certain FTP servers, entering "" would bring a user to its home directory 
  (for example /home/user) instead of the document root. Then, when clicking 
  on a subdirectory link (for example /subdir), net2ftp would assume this 
  subdirectory to be /subdir, whereas in fact it would be /home/user/subdir

* In browse(), ftp_chdir is now always executed; before, it was not executed if 
  the directory was ""

* When sending feedback via the form, single quotes were escaped (' became /'). 
  This is corrected.

* The layout has been adapted a little in most action (rename, chmod,...) screens: 
  the text is now aligned 50 px from the left border, instead of in the middle.


February 2003: version 0.4
==========================

Following the feedback of some users, here are the bugfixes:

* Function fopen is now used with the "b" option, which is (only) useful on Windows 
  servers

* The deletion of directories is now done with ftp_rmdir instead of ftp_delete

* The file layout_server.inc.php is merged in settings.inc.php

* All the arrays are now used with ['string'] instead of [string], as 
  recommended in the manual

* In the INSTALL file is now pointed out how to change the appearance of the
  login screen

* The database use is now by default set to no, to make the install easier.

February 2003: version 0.3
==========================

This version contains new features, and bug fixes.

New features:

* Copy and move files to a SECOND FTP server! This is handy for developers, 
who develop and test on a different environment than the production environment.

* If you change $myname and $mydomain in the settings.inc.php file, the layout 
of the login page is different from what is on net2ftp.com.

* If the security settings (in settings.inc.php) are set to restrict the access 
to some FTP servers only, this is reflected on the login page.


Bug fixes:

* Check the authorization only if $check_authorization is set to yes in 
settings.inc.php.

* The nr of lines in the edit form is reduced from 37 to 35 in 
layout_server.inc.php, because in Mozilla based browsers each line is a little 
taller than in IE.

* After doing some tests on different public FTP servers, it appears that they
reply differently to the ftp_rawlist request -- thanks to Ondrej for reporting 
this.
     - some FTP servers, like ftp.belnet.be, start with a line summarizing how 
       many subdirectories and files there are in the current directory. The 
       real list of subdirectories and files starts on the second line. This 
       worked well in net2ftp.

              [0] => total 15
              [1] => drwxr-xr-x 11 BELNET Archive 512 Feb 6 2000 BELNET
              [2] => drwxr-xr-x 2 BELNET Archive 512 Oct 29 2001 FVD-SFI

     - some other FTP servers, like ftp.redhat.com/pub, start directly with the 
       list of subdirectories and files. The first entry is omitted in net2ftp, 
       because it was assumed the first line would be used for the summary.

              [0] => drwxr-xr-x 9 ftp ftp 4096 Jan 11 06:34 contrib
              [1] => drwxr-xr-x 13 ftp ftp 4096 Jan 29 21:59 redhat
              [2] => drwxrwsr-x 6 ftp ftp 4096 Jun 05 2002 up2date


February 2003: version 0.2
==========================

This version is mainly released to make the application work with PHP > 4.0.6 
and with register_globals set to off.

* There is a new file: registerglobals.inc.php; this is to make the application 
work, even if register_globals is set to off.

* The ftp_close function has been renamed to ftp_closeconnection, so that the 
application would work with PHP > 4.0.6. Note that now, ftp_quit does not 
return TRUE or FALSE any more

* The ftp_get and ftp_put functions must now take FTP_ASCII and FTP_BINARY 
without the double quotes. In PHP 4.0.6 it was assumed that with the double 
quotes, FTP_ASCII was meant.

* The HTML layout has been modified a little, there are 2 different CSS 
templates.

* The file upload function has been modified (better error handling, if the 
temp directory has not been chmodded during the installation, or if no files 
are supplied).

* It is possible to use net2ftp without a database. The use_database setting 
is now taken into account. 



January 2003: version 0.1 - first release for developers
========================================================

* Since this is the first version, everything is new !
